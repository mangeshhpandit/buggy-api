Problem statement

    The app when it comes up will have 2 users created in the system -
        user1@gmail.com with password user1ABC
        user2@gmail.com with password user2ABC

    user1@gmail.com cant login but user2@gmail.com can

    You can use the try it out feature on the swagger page with for the /login API to simulate this.Alternately you can use any choice of REST client for the same.

    The output expected out of this is as follows
        Debug why the login for user1@gmail.com fails.
        Once the bug is discovered fix it and submit the assignment via git


*****************************Solution*******************************
When we trying to login using user1@gmail.com login gets fails and console shows the error as
"query did not return a unique result: 2; nested exception is javax.persistence.NonUniqueResultException: query did not return a unique result: 2",
  "path": "/user/login"  .."
  
  because in database there are 2 entries with same name and same password,when we install and setup the all project and run 
  it as boot application then it create 3 database entry by default user1@gmail.com created two times
  thats why it fails to login

  If we remove the duplicate entry form file db.changelog-1.0.xml and again run the application as Spring boot app then user 
  can login successfully...
  
  Issue find and fix successfully
